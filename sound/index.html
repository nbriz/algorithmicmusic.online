        <p>
          Before we talk about music, we need to talk about sound, what it is and how we’ll be making it. Sound happens when something vibrates, like a vocal chord, a guitar string or a speaker. These vibrations cause the tiny particles in the air around it to move, creating patterns of squished-together areas (compressions) and spread-out areas (rarefactions). These patterns travel outward as waves. When these waves reach your ears, they make your eardrum vibrate in the same pattern. Your brain takes these vibrations and processes them into what you experience as sound—like speech, music or noise. In a way, sound only exists in your mind: it's your brain's way of interpreting the physical vibrations in the air into a meaningful hallucination. Without a listener, “sound” is nothing more than patterns of vibrations in the air.
        </p>

        <am-range id="speed" min="0" max="100" step="1"></am-range>
        <div class="range-label">vibration speed (aka "frequency" or "pitch")</div>

        <am-range id="intensity" min="0" max="100" step="1"></am-range>
        <div class="range-label">vibration intensity (aka "amplitude" or "volume")</div>

        <br><br>

        <p>
          The pitch of a sound depends on how fast the particles are vibrating, and the volume depends on how much they’re moving. A sound's <strong>pitch</strong> is also called its <strong>frequency</strong>, which is measured in <strong>hertz (Hz)</strong> or cycles per second. Faster vibrations create higher frequencies and higher-pitched sounds, while slower vibrations create lower frequencies and lower-pitched sounds. The <strong>volume</strong> (loudness) of a sound depends on the wave's <strong>amplitude</strong>—how strong or "tall" the wave is. Higher amplitude means louder sounds, and it's measured in <strong>decibels (dB)</strong>. A decibel is a unit that measures how loud a sound is, using a scale where every 10 dB means the sound is 10 times more intense than the previous level. In short, amplitude controls loudness, and frequency controls pitch.
        </p>

        <p>
          We'll be generating sound by vibrating speakers attached to our computer. These could be small headphone speakers or larger blue-tooth connected speakers.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>

        <h3 class="formatted-text">digital sound</h3>

        <p>
          So how can we tell our computer to vibrate its speakers? One way we can make sounds with our computer is by using a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) like Ableton or FL Studio. Apps like these are perfect when you want to make music the same way everyone else does, but when we want to push the boundaries of music and leverage the full potential of this <a href="http://www.newmediareader.com/book_samples/nmr-26-kay.pdf" target="_blank">meta-medium</a> we turn to code. Rather than simply “use” software someone else wrote, we can “program” our own by writing code. When we use pre-made software we’re limited to the buttons, knobs and menus the developer created for us. While this saves us the time it would take to write our own, it also limits what/how we create to what/how that developer imagined we would want to create.
        </p>

        <p>
          There’s lots of different coding languages and environments used to create sound, because our goal is to create works that we can publish online for anyone to access on the open web, we’ll be using JavaScript, the web’s de facto programming language. A website or web app is written first and foremost in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML" target="_blank">HTML</a>, a simple beginner friendly coding langauge for structuring content on the web. We won't be discussing HTML too much in this class, but if u're familiar with HTML (and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS" target="_blank">CSS</a>) feel free to use them as much as you'd like in your work. In this class we'll be focusing almost exclusively on JavaScript, but we do need a little bit of HTML in order to write JavaScript in the browser, it starts with the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> element, between which we can write JavaScript code. When we run JavaScript in a web browser we’re given access to the Web Audio API, a collection of pre-made functions for generating sound from scratch.

        <p>
          In the examples above we created two different sounds entirely from scratch, by calculating the raw data (number values) for each. These two sounds in some sense are opposites. The first was completely random, pure “noise” like the sound of a consonant in speech or the crash symbol on a drum set. The second was a “tone” like the sound of a vowel in speech or a key on a piano. It’s actually the purest tone we could make, the sound of a “sine wave”.

        <div class="range-label">volume <span id="vol-val">5</span></div>

        <p>
          However, pure sine waves don’t exist in the natural world, they can only ever be synthesized electronically (be it analog or digital). Most "natural" sounds with repetitive or predictable vibrations—what we hear as musical tones—are a mix of a <strong>fundamental</strong> frequency (the dominant tone, like 440 Hz for A4) and additional frequencies called <strong>overtones</strong> or <strong>harmonics</strong>. These overtones are multiples of the fundamental and give the sound its complexity.
        </p>

        <p>
          This mix of frequencies creates a sound’s <strong>timbre</strong>, the unique quality or texture that makes a guitar and a piano playing the same note sound different. While they share the same fundamental frequency, their overtones are emphasized differently, giving each instrument its distinctive "color." Overtones are what make musical tones rich and varied, compared to the pure simplicity of a sine wave.
        </p>

        <svg id="timbre-spec"></svg>

        <p>
          In digital audio, we often describe four basic wave types, each with unique characteristics. Sine waves are pure tones, containing only the fundamental frequency with no harmonics, making them smooth and simple. Square waves are richer, combining the fundamental with only the odd-numbered harmonics (e.g., 3rd, 5th, 7th), giving them a buzzy, hollow sound. Saw waves are even more complex, containing the fundamental and all harmonics, which creates a bright, edgy sound often used in synth music. Triangle waves are similar to square waves but softer; they also include only odd harmonics, but the higher harmonics are much quieter, resulting in a more subdued, rounded tone. Each wave shape has a distinct frequency content, shaping its sound and timbre.

        <h3 class="formatted-text">online theremin</h3>
        <p>
          We've now learned enough code to make an online <strong>theremin</strong>. Historically, the theremin was one of the first electronic instruments, invented in the 1920s by Léon Theremin. Instead of physical strings or keys, the theremin generates sound by translating the distance of your hands from two antennas into control signals for pitch and volume. It works by creating magnetic fields around its antennas, which are sensitive to the proximity of your hands. As your hand moves closer to the vertical pitch antenna, it alters the frequency of an analog oscillator, raising or lowering the pitch. Similarly, moving your other hand near the horizontal volume antenna changes another magnetic field, adjusting the amplitude (loudness) of the sound. In the example below I've created a digital theramin which uses the mouse instead of antennas. Holding the mouse button down produces the sound, then moving the mouse left/right changes the pitch while moving it up/down changes the volume.

      <div class="content">
        <p>
          There's some new code we haven't seen before. Towards the bottom you'll notice <code>nn.on()</code> event listeners, similar to the ones we've seen before except this time the <code>.on()</code> method is attached directly to the <code>nn</code> object. When we do this we're essentially saying we want to listen for events in the entire window (rather than on a specific UI element). We're also listening for some new events we haven't seen yet, 'mousedown' which will trigger the <code>start</code> function, 'mouseup' which will trigger the <code>stop</code> function and 'mousemove' which triggers the <code>update</code> function. The update function takes the event object and maps its <code>e.x</code> and <code>e.y</code> values (the horizontal and vertical mouse coordinates) to specific ranges using the <code>nn.map()</code> method. This method takes more arguments than we've seen any other method or function take so it's worth discussing a bit.
        </p>

        <p>
          The <code>map</code> method is used to take value which falls within a given range and convert it to another value in the same position of a different range. For example, if our value is "6" representing the 6th hour in a range from 0-12 we could map that to another range for example 0-100. In this range the 6 would become 50, because 6 is directly in the center of it's range (1-12) and the center of the new range (0-100) would be 50.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the case of our theremin, it takes the mouse's horizontal position <code>e.x</code> which will be a value between 0 and the width of our page. Every user will have a different sized page, so rather than hard-coding the value for the width of the page we can pull it dynamically using <code>nn.width</code>. Then we map this value to a new range between 220 (the lowest note I want to play, an "A3" on a piano) and 1760 (the highest note I want to play, an "A7"). Similarly the mouse's vertical position <code>e.y</code> gets mapped to a new range of 0 to -80, so that when our mouse is at the top of the page it's volume is unchanged, but when it's at the bottom of the page we lower it by -80 db.

          For homework read "<a href="https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20201111-the-theremin-the-strangest-instrument-ever-invented" target="_blank">The theremin: The strangest instrument ever invented?</a>" and then experiment with the example above to create your own variation. Consider using some of the other UI (user interface) elements covered in the previous examples. Consider the other adjustable paramters we've covered and how you might want to limit or enable control over them with the interface you present to the user. At its core, the theremin generates a simple sine wave—the purest form of sound with no harmonics (you can change that of course). Yet, through its motion-controlled pitch and volume, it transforms this basic tone into a uniquely expressive and dynamic musical instrument, allowing players to "sculpt" sound in real time. We might only be at the beginning of our algorithmic music journey, but we have already enough tools to make something interesting, what is required now is practice and lots of experimentation.
