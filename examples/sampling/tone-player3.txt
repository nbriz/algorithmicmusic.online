The <code>new Tone.Players()</code> (plural) lets you load more than one audio file by passing an object with key/value pairs <code>{ key: value }</code>, where the "key" is the property name you want to give to that file and "value" is a path to the file. In this example we're using our computer's keyboard as the interface, by listening for specific key presses and then triggering <code>.start()</code> on specific files depending on the key that was pressed.
