The Tone.js player instance also has a <code>.playbackRate</code> propery which controls the speed of the playback, the default is "1", smaller values will slow playback down and faster values will speed it up. In this example we're using the mouse's X position (horizontal position) to adjust the speed, however we don't want to assign it's value directly to the playback rate because those values are too large, instead we'll use <code>nn.map()</code> to map it to a range more suitable for a playback rate.
