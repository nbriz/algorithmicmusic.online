In this example we've introduced our first <strong>processing node</strong>, the <a href="https://tonejs.github.io/docs/15.0.4/classes/Gain.html" target="_blank">Gain Node</a>. The Gain Node allows us to take a signal that's connected to it and adjust it's amplitude or volume level before sending it back out. So now, instead of connecting our Oscillator directly to the "destination", we're connecting it to the Gain Node, and we connect our Gaine Node to the destination. We've created the simplest audio signal <strong>chain</strong>, with a source node connected to a processing node connected to a destination.
