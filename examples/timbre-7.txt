The previous example limits us to wave shapes that have names, essentialy "sine", "square", "triangle" and "sawtooth". But we can also set the type to "custom" and define our own custom wave shape by setting an additional <code>partials</code> property on our oscillator. The value for this is an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array" target="_blank">Array</a>, a list of values separated by commas and surrounded by <code>[</code> brackets <code>]</code>. Each of the values in this array represent the level of the next harmonic (or overtone) which accompanies the fundamental. You can have as many or as little harmonics as you want.
