We can connect more than one effect together, when we want to <code>chain</code> effects we could connect them all individually by writing <code>synth.connect(reverb)</code> and then <code>reverb.connect(phaser)</code> and then <code>phaser.toDestination()</code>, but we could also use the <code>.chain()</code> method to more easily chain together a number of effect nodes. Keep in mind, if you want a more complex set of connections (that isn't a straight line like this) then the <code>.connect()</code> method is likely best.
