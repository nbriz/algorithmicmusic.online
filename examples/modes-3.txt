In this last example we'll hear what these scales actually sound like. I'm using the same <code>createScale</code> function to generate two C major scales, one in the 2nd octave (for our lower "bass" notes) and the second in the 4th octave (for our higher "lead" notes). Below that is some logic which should look familiar from a previous synth example, where we use our keyboard to trigger "attack" and "release", in this case the "a" key is used to play the next note in the bassScale while the "s" key is used to pick a random note from the leadScale. Playing these together should always sound "musical" because our system ensures we never play a note "out of key" (it is however possible to play them out of rhythm, that part is up to the performer)
