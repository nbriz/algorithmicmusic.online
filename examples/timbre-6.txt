Here we've added a function to change the wave type of the oscillator called <code>changeType</code> as well as another UI (user interface) element, an text input field. We've set a default value of "sine" to our input field as well as attached an <strong>event listener</strong>, except instead of "click", this time it's "change", so when the text in our input changes it will run the <code>changeType</code> function. Because this function is being called by an event listener we can optionally listen for the event object (which we're calling <code>e</code>) which gets passed to the function when it is called by the listener. There's lots of info we can get from these objects including <code>e.target.value</code>, which is the current text in the input field.
