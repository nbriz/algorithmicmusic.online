We start by creating a new "<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioContext" target="_blank">audio context</a>". We store a reference to our new audio context in a variable, I've called it "ctx" for short. Because I never plan to change this variable I've declared it with the <code>const</code> keyword. (Click on the "next" button above to keep building on this example).
