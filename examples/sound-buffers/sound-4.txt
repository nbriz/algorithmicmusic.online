In order to create actual sounds with the Web Audio API we must create a <strong>source node</strong>, here I've created one called "noise" using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/BaseAudioContext/createBufferSource" target="_blank">createBufferSource</a> method. I've applied our custom buffer to the source's buffer and connected it to our <strong>destination</strong>, which is whatever output interface currently set in your computer's audio settings. Lastly we call our source's <code>.start()</code> method to begin playing our sound. <br><br> Now we can press the "run code" button above our code to run the code and hear our sound! Warning: it will be loud!
