We can take all that code and package it inside our own <strong>function</strong>. Instead of defining the <code>freq</code> value inside the function, I'm declaring it as my function's argument, so I can pass in the value I want. My function <strong>returns</strong> a reference to the audio source node called <code>tone</code>. This means when I call my function on line 23 I can store that reference in a new variable called "note". Then I can start the node's playback as I did before.
