Now instead of filling the buffer with random values between -1 and 1 (which essentially creates "noise"), we'll use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_and_cosine" target="_blank">sine</a> function to create a series of oscillating values between -1 and 1. Meaning the numbers will smoothly go up from -1 to 1 before smoothly dropping back down to -1 over and over again. If we pass whole integer values (0, 1, 2, 3, etc) it will oscillate between -1 and 1 fairly quickly, which means we'll get a very "high" pitch, to slow it down (and lower the pitch) we can scale down the value we pass into the sine function.
