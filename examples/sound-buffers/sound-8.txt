Now we've added a second argument to our function called <code>amp</code> with a default value of 1. on line 14, where the sample values get created, we're now multiplying the sample value by this new amount. To start we've set it to 1 which means the sample value won't change, but if we make this a value lower than one (decimal value 0-1) then this value will essentially "scale" all our samples by that amount, in effect allowing us to control the amplitude of our wave, or put another way: the volume of our sound.
