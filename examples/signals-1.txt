The most fundamental tone generatring source in audio synthesis is the Oscillator, in Tone.js we cann access it via the <a href="https://tonejs.github.io/docs/15.0.4/classes/Oscillator.html" target="_blank">Tone.Oscillator()</a> class. When passed two arguments into it's <strong>constructor</strong> the first value is the frequency or pitch we want, the second is the "type" or shape of the wave we want (either "sine", "square", "triangle", "sawtooth").
