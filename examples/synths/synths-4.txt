Since the <code>PolySynth</code> can play multiple notes at the same time, we could create something like a piano by mapping our 'keydown' and 'keyup' events to functions that handle <code>attack</code> and <code>release</code>. These functions use a <code>keyMap</code> for determining which keyboard keys should map to which frequencies, as well as keeping track of whether that key is currently pressed down or not, this way we know whether we should trigger the synth's attack or release.
