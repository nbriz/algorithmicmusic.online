Having individual control over the attack and release is great for creating your own playable online instruments, but when it comes time to working on algorithmic compositions where we need to programatic trigger both attack and release we have the <a href="https://tonejs.github.io/docs/15.0.4/classes/Synth.html#triggerAttackRelease" target="_blank">triggerAttackRelease()</a> method. This method takes two required arguments, the first being the pitch or note (as a Tone.js <a href="https://tonejs.github.io/docs/15.0.4/types/Unit.Frequency.html" target="_blank">frequency unit</a>) and the second being the duration the tone plays for (a Tone.js <a href="https://tonejs.github.io/docs/15.0.4/types/Unit.Time.html" target="_blank">time unit</a>). It also takes two more optional arguments, a third argument stipulating when the note should be played (also a <a href="https://tonejs.github.io/docs/15.0.4/types/Unit.Time.html" target="_blank">time unit</a>), if none is specified it will play immediately, and a fourth argument for the velocity (or volume).
