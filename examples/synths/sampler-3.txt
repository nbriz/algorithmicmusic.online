In the last example you might have noticed that when we trigger attacks for notes further away from the reference note (C4 in that case) the pitching effect is more drastic. This could be something you embrace or do on-purpose, but it might also not be the desired effect. In this example we've added more than one note property to the "url" object, this way the sampler has more options to choose from and may not need to drastically pitch-shift the sample as much. In this example we've loaded different piano sound files to recreate the sound as a piano as closely as we can, while this is a more conventional use of the sampler remember that our goal in this course is not to reproduce instruments that already exist, but rather invent entirely new ones.
