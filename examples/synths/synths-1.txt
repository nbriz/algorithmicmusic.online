The <a href="https://tonejs.github.io/docs/15.0.4/classes/Synth.html#triggerAttack" target="_blank">triggerAttack()</a> method of a Tone.js Instrument takes at least one argument, the pitch (as a Tone.js <a href="https://tonejs.github.io/docs/15.0.4/types/Unit.Frequency.html" target="_blank">frequency unit</a>) you want the synth to play. You could send a couple of additional arguments like this <code>synth.triggerAttack(440, "+0.5", 0.5)</code>, where the second argument is a time delay (start half a second after the method is called) and the third argument is for the <strong>velocity</strong> or how loud the note should play. The <a href="https://tonejs.github.io/docs/15.0.4/classes/Synth.html#triggerRelease" target="_blank">triggerRelease()</a> method does not require any arguments, but does take an optional argument for the time delay (otherwise it releases the note as soon as it's called).
