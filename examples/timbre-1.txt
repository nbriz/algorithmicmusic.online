Let’s experiment with timbre directly through code. In order to make our lives a little bit easier we’re going to be using a JavaScript library called <a href="https://tonejs.github.io/" target="_blank">Tone.js</a> by Yotam Mann and other <a href="https://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js/graphs/contributors" target="_blank">collaborators</a>. In programming, a <strong>library</strong> is a set of reusable pieces of code (like <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Functions" target="_blank">functions</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes target="_blank">classes</a>) packaged up in a single file for others to use and build on. In the case of Tone.js, Yotam and others have written code extending the Web Audio API (which is typically only concerned with “sound”) to provide us with a more “musically” focused set of tools.
