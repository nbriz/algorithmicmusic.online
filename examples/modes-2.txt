In this example we do something very similar to the last, except that rather than using one of the 7 pre-defined Greek Modes, we've created a <code>randomMode</code> function which returns a mode array, a list of step values. Like the Greek Modes this will only involve full-steps (ie 2) or half-steps (or semitones, ie 1) and will always include 8 notes, ensuring never to exceed the octave.
