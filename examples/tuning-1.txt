Here is the algorithm for calculating the frequencies for 12-tone equal temperament, where we divide the octave into 12 equally spaced values to derive our notes. The function <code>calcNote</code> takes two arguments, the first is the "root" frequency which is used as the base value from which to calculate the other frequencies. The second argument is the number of notes away from the base frequency we'd like to calculate the frequency for.
