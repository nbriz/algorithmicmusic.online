Rather than having our sound start automatically (which won't work in most browsers) we're going to be triggering our sound only when the user clicks on a button. In order to create quick and simple interfaces we'll import another library, a creative coding utility kit I made called <a href="https://github.com/netizenorg/netnet-standard-library" target="_blank">nn.min.js</a>. Then we'll wrap our calls to <code>osc.start()</code> and <code>osc.stop()</code> inside of a function, this way they only run when we call our new function. Then we can use the <code>nn</code> library to create a button which calls our <code>play</code> function when clicked.
