The <a href="https://tonejs.github.io/docs/15.0.4/classes/Player.html#start" target="_blank">start()</a> method of the Player class allows us to pass three optional arguments, the first argument is "when" the player should start playing (relative to our Audio Context clock), the second is an "offset" or how many seconds into the loaded track we should begin the playback from and the third argument is the "duration", how long the sample should play before it stops
