You may not be surprised to know, that because this is such a common effect, it already comes pre-made in the Tone.js library. In this example we're using the Tone.j's built in <a href="https://tonejs.github.io/docs/15.0.4/classes/Tremolo.html" target="_">Tremolo</a> class instead of the one we made, but it's important to now that all the "effects" built in to Tone.js are really just signal chains like the one we made. Which means we can create our own versions of these effects when the built-in ones don't work quite as we'd like, or we could create our own custom effects not included in the library.
