In this example we've swapped our button for a toggle checkbox which can switch our tone on and off. Even though our buffer is only 1 second long, we can have it play forever by setting the source node's <code>loop</code> property to <i>true</i>. Our <code>toggle</code> function now handle's conditionally checking if the sound is currently playing or stopped and either creates a new buffer to play or stops the current the one.
