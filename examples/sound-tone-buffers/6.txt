For the next set of examples I've hidden all the HTML elements, namely the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags being used to import the libraries. I've done this to remove some of the visual clutter from the editor, the rest of the examples will make use of the same set of libraries so there's no need to focus on that part of the code for now. Rest assured the code is still there, it's only hidden, if you click the buttons to copy, download or open the code in netnet you'll see the import <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> again. I've also declared the <code>freq</code> variable as an argument of the <code>createCustomBuffer</code> function, this way we can generate a different "random" pitch each time we press the button. We've also added another function for visualizing the frequency spectrum in addition to the weaveform.
