We now know that in order to change the timbre of our wave we need to change it's shape. We explained earlier that one way to do that is to add additional harmonics to the  fundamental which is exactly what I've done in this example. I've created a variable to keep track of the number of harmonics we want which I've called <code>numHarmonics</code>, then inside the loop I've been using to fill the buffer, I first set the sample's value to 0 before calculating it's value inside a third <code>for</code> loop. I use this loop iterate over every odd harmonic slowly incrementing that sample to it's target value.
