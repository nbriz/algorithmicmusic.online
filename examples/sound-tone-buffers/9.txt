While the previous example is great for expressing our logic in terms of the harmonics we want, the goal here is just to create a square shaped wave, meaning it's either 1 or -1, no values in between. So we could approach this entirely differently. Instead we could calculate the sine wave and then check if the current sample is above the line (greater than 0) or below it, if so we round up to 1 otherwise we round down to -1.
