Inside the the createCustomBuffer function well create a couple of <code>for</code> loops, the outer loop iterates over each channel (first the "left" speaker channel, then the "right" speaker channel) and creates a <code>samples</code> data array for each. The inner loop iterates over each sample value within the array and uses the <code>nn.random()</code> method to create a random value between -0.25 and 0.25 for each. This method comes from the <a href="https://github.com/netizenorg/netnet-standard-library?tab=readme-ov-file#netnet-standard-library" target="_blank">netnet-standard-library</a> (or <code>nn.min.js</code> for short) which we've imported on line 2, and noted in our comment on line 4. Lastly, on line 26 we call <code>noise.start()</code> to play our buffer automatically.
