As mentioned earlier, in order to make our lives a little bit easier weâ€™re going to be using a JavaScript library called <a href="https://tonejs.github.io/" target="_blank">Tone.js</a> by Yotam Mann and other <a href="https://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js/graphs/contributors" target="_blank">collaborators</a>. In programming, a <strong>library</strong> is a set of reusable pieces of code (like <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Functions" target="_blank">functions</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes target="_blank">classes</a>) packaged up in a single file for others to use and build on. To import a JavaScript library in HTML we use the same <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> we used to write our code, except rather than writing code between the opening and closing tags, we'll use the <code>src</code> attribute to point to a URL containing all of the library's code. On line 3 I've left a special comment which lets the editor (and anyone looking at our code) know that this library exposes a new global object for us to use called <code>Tone</code>, which we're using on line 5 to create a new <code>BufferSource()</code> audio node and immediately connect that to our destination. We did this earlier with the Web Audio API, but now we're doing this with Tone.js.
