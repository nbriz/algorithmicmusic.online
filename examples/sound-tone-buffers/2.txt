Next we'll create a function which will "abstract" the process of creating a sound buffer, this time using the Tone.js API. This function will take two arguments, first the length of our buffer in <code>seconds</code> and second the number of <code>channels</code> we want our buffer to have. The function will return the buffer which we can store in a variable to pass into Tone's <code>BufferSource()</code> constructor.
