With an audio context, we can create sound from scratch using an <strong>audio buffer</strong>. A <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/BaseAudioContext/createBuffer" target="_blank">buffer</a> holds the raw data—number values that represent the sound. Before creating this data, we need to set the buffer’s parameters. First, we define the number of <strong>channels</strong>, which corresponds to the number of speakers (e.g., 1 for mono, 2 for stereo). Second, we set the buffer’s <strong>length</strong> by multiplying the desired duration in seconds by the <strong>sample rate</strong>. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(signal_processing)" target="_blank">sample rate</a> is the number of values used per second of sound, typically 44,100 (44.1 kHz). Lastly, we specify the sample rate itself.
