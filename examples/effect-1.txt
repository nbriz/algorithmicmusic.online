In this example we've created a Synth and a [Reverb](https://tonejs.github.io/docs/15.0.4/classes/Reverb.html) processing node. We've connected the synth to the reverb and the reverb to the destination which means the sound generated by the synth will be processed by the reverb before we hear it come out of the speakers.
