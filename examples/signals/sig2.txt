We can also change our Oscillator's settings after we've created it by reassigning the value of the specific property we want to change with the <code>.set()</code> method. Our updated <code>play()</code> function now also randomizes the pitch by changing the the "frequency" of the "osc" by setting it to a random value between 220 and 880 using the nn library's <code>nn.random()</code> function.
