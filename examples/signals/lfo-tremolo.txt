Now instead of using our LFO to modulate the Oscillator's frequency (or pitch) we're using it to <strong>modulate</strong> the GainNode's gain value (or volume level) by connecting the LFO direclty to that instead. What we've done is essentially created a common effect known as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tremolo" target="_blank">tremolo</a>.
