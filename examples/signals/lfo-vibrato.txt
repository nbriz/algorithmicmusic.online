Now we've added a new source node to our chain, the <a href="https://tonejs.github.io/docs/15.0.4/classes/LFO.html" target="_blank">LFO</a>, which stands for "low frequency oscillator". Unlike our other Oscillator the source produced by this node isn't designed to be sent to our destination, instead the oscillation is used to <strong>modulate</strong> (regulated change) a value of any other node. In this example we're using it to modulate the frequency of our tone generating oscillator. This creates an effect known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibrato" target="_blank">vibrato</a>
