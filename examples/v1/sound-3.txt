Now we’ll create the “samples”, the raw data (number values) that we’ll fill each channel of our buffer with. These are essentially a list of values ranging from -1 to 1, which directly tell your speaker how to move. Each value represents the position of the speaker cone at a specific moment: 1 means push out fully, -1 means pull in fully, and numbers in between represent smaller movements. As the buffer values are played in sequence, they make the speaker vibrate back and forth, creating the sound waves we hear as vibrations in the air, 44,100 values (or speaker positions) per second.
