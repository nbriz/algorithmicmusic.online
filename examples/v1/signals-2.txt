Instead of passing the frequency and type as two separate arguments into the Oscillator's constructor, we could also define the settings by passing parameters object, a list of properties and values, this <a href="https://tonejs.github.io/docs/15.0.4/interfaces/ToneOscillatorOptions.html" target="_blank">parameters object</a> allows us to edit many of the Oscillator's properties. Above we're creating a "custom" wave type (as opposed to the built-in types like "sine", "square", "triangle" and "sawtooth") by specifying the amplitude (0-1) of the harmonic/overtones of our fundamental (which is 440 Hz).
