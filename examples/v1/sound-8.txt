Though the Web Audio API gives us very “low level” control, allowing us to create audio buffers from scratch, it also provides “higher level” abstractions. The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/BaseAudioContext/createOscillator" target="_blank">createOscillator</a> method allows us to create a source node that generates a sine wave with much less code (and more features) than before. This sine wave will run forever until we tell it to “stop”.
