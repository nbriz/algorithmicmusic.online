Sampling can also refer to recording individual sounds, like a single piano note or a drum hit, to create a "sample library" that can be used to play or program new music. We need more than one Player instance to load individual sounds, but rather than creating multiple instances, we can use the <a href="https://tonejs.github.io/docs/15.0.4/classes/Players.html" target="_blank">Players</a> (plural) class. This can be used to load multiple sound files, we can then call the individual sound's start methods.
