Even though we've only set a sample for the note value 'C4', we can still play other notes because what makes this Sampler class special is it's ability to automatically repitch the samples, essentially turning our single sound into multiple different notes. In the previous example, you might have noticed that holding down the "q" key triggers multiple calls to the <code>triggerAttack</code> method, causing it to repeat quickly. If we want it to behave more like a piano, where the sound does not repeat until after we press the key again, we can create a "keyMap" dictionary object, which maps keys not only to specific notes, but also keeps track of whether that key is currently pressed down. Then we can create custom "attack" and "release" functions which not only specifies which note to play or release, but also keeps track of whether or not it's currently pressed down.
