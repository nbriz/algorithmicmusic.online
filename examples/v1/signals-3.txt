We can also change our Oscillator's settings after we've created it by reassigning the value of the specific property we want to change. Our updated <code>play()</code> function now also randomizes the pitch by changing the "value" of the "frequency" of the "osc" by setting it to a random value between 220 and 440 using the nn library's <code>nn.random()</code> function. We're also now randomizing the partial values by <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map" target="_blank">mapping</a> through them and changing each at random. We could have also used a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for" target="_blank">for loop</a> to change all the partial values individually, but the mapping method allows for less code.
