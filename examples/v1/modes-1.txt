In this example I've created a function called <code>createScale</code> which takes two arguments, the first is the <strong>tonic</strong> note (sometimes also referred to as the <strong>root</strong> note or <strong>base</strong> note) it will become the first note in the scale and thus <strong>tonal center</strong> of our scale, or put another way, the "<strong>key</strong>" are scale is in. The second argument our function takes is the mode we want to use to generate a scale, this will be an array of number values indicating the amount of steps we want between each subsequent note in our scale.
