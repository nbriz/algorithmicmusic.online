Now, in order to visualize our sound we'll import three more libraries. The first is <a href="https://d3js.org/" target="_blank">d3.js</a>, one of the most popular JavaScript libraries for data visualization. After that we're importing a couple of functions I made, <a href="https://algorithmicmusic.online/js/create-spectrum.js" target="_blank">createSpectrum</a> and <a href="https://algorithmicmusic.online/js/create-waveform.js" target="_blank">createWaveform</a>, these use the d3 library to create audio visualizations. Once imported we can create a new instance of both (lines 11 and 13), set any parameters we might want to adjust and then we'll connect our oscillator to both our visuals (lines 21 and 22).
