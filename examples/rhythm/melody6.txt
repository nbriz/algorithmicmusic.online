This version builds on the previous sketch by adding a simple <strong>bassline</strong> using the same <strong>key</strong> and <strong>mode</strong>, but one octave lower. In the new <code>triggerBass()</code> function, we play either the <strong>root</strong> or the <strong>fifth</strong> of the scale depending on whether the current bar is even or oddâ€”providing harmonic context and a sense of structure. The bass note is only triggered on the <strong>first beat</strong> of each measure, using a fixed duration of <code>'1n'</code> (whole note). This creates a clear, repeating tonal center that grounds the randomized melody above it.
