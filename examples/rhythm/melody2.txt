In this example, the <code>note</code> is generated by randomly selecting a pitch from <code>nn.notes</code> and combining it with a random octave (either <code>3</code> or <code>4</code>), forming strings like <code>'C#3'</code> or <code>'G4'</code>. The <code>dur</code> (duration) is chosen from an array of Tone.js <strong>timing strings</strong> like <code>'4n'</code> or <code>'16n'</code>, which represent musical note lengths synced to the current tempo. These two values are then passed to <code>synth.triggerAttackRelease()</code> to play each note with a random pitch and length.
