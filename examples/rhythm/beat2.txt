This example introduces how Tone.js handles musical time using the <strong>Transport</strong> system. We configure the <code>Transport</code> by setting its <strong>tempo</strong> with <code>.bpm.value</code>, changing the <strong>time signature</strong> to <code>3</code> (so each measure has 3 beats), and enabling looping with <code>.loop = true</code>. The loop length is defined by <code>.loopEnd = '2m'</code>, which means the sequence will repeat every 2 measures. On each beat, the <code>play()</code> function is called, and we use <code>Tone.Transport.position</code> to get the current location in the form of a string like <code>"bar:beat:sixteenth"</code>. By splitting this string into numbers, we can track the current <strong>measure</strong> and <strong>beat</strong> in real time. These values are displayed in the UI and used to trigger a <strong>clap sample</strong>, giving us a clear, audible sense of the Transportâ€™s timing.
