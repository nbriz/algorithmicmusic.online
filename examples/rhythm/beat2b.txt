This example adds a simple <strong>step sequencer</strong> using a two-dimensional <code>pattern</code> array, where each sub-array represents a <strong>measure</strong> and each number inside it represents a <strong>beat</strong>: with <code>1</code> meaning "play" and <code>0</code> meaning "rest." In the <code>play()</code> function, we extract the current <strong>bar</strong> and <strong>beat</strong> from <code>Tone.Transport.position</code> and use them to look up the corresponding step in the pattern. If the value is <code>1</code>, the <strong>clap sample</strong> is triggered with <code>clap.start(time)</code>. We also update a <strong>visual sequencer</strong> using <code>seq.update()</code> to reflect playback in real time. The <strong>Transport</strong> is configured to loop over the full pattern by matching its <code>.timeSignature</code> and <code>.loopEnd</code> to the structure of the sequence.
