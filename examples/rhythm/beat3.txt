The <code>play()</code> logic here works almost exactly like the previous example, but now instead of a single sound and pattern, we're working with multiple drum sounds using a <strong>multi-sample player</strong> called <code>Tone.Players</code>. The <code>pattern</code> is now an <strong>object</strong>, where each key (like <code>kick</code>, <code>snare</code>, or <code>hihat</code>) maps to its own step sequence. On each beat, the <code>play()</code> function loops through each sequence in the object, calculates the current index using <code>beat % pattern[drum].length</code>, and checks if the value at that index is <code>1</code>. If it is, it triggers the corresponding sound using <code>drumset.player(drum).start(time)</code>. This allows multiple rhythms to play together, creating a full drum pattern. As before, the <strong>Transport</strong> keeps time, and the <strong>beat counter</strong> increments with each loop, while <code>seq.update()</code> keeps the visual sequencer in sync.
