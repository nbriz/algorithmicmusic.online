What makes this new <code>play()</code> function unique is that it replaces the fixed, binary decision-making of the previous sequencers with <strong>probability-based logic</strong>. Instead of each step being a simple <code>1</code> (play) or <code>0</code> (don’t play), each step now holds a <strong>chance value</strong> between <code>0</code> and <code>1</code> that represents how likely it is that the sound will trigger on that beat. Inside the loop, we generate a random number each time using <code>nn.random()</code> and compare it to the probability value at that step. If the random number is less than the assigned value, the sound plays. This means every time the sequence runs, the result will feel similar but be slightly different—adding variation and unpredictability.
