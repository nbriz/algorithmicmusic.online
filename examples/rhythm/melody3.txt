In this example, the <code>note</code> is selected from a dynamically generated <strong>minor scale</strong>, built by combining the chosen root key (from the dropdown) with a fixed set of step intervals. The scale is created using <code>nn.createScale()</code>, which returns an array of note strings like <code>'C3'</code>, <code>'D3'</code>, <code>'Eb3'</code>, etc. A random note from this scale is then selected and played using <code>synth.triggerAttackRelease()</code> with a fixed duration of <code>'4n'</code> (quarter note), ensuring all notes stay within the chosen key and scale.
