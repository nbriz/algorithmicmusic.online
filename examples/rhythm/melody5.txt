This version introduces <strong>generative melody logic</strong>: instead of hardcoding notes, we use <code>createMelody()</code> to randomly choose a <strong>key</strong>, <strong>octave</strong>, and <strong>mode</strong>, then build a scale using <code>nn.createScale()</code>. For each beat in each measure, we randomly decide whether to place a note or a <code>'rest'</code>, and if itâ€™s a note, we randomly select both its <strong>pitch</strong> (from the scale) and <strong>duration</strong>. Each generated note is added to the <strong>melody array</strong> and displayed in a synced <strong>piano roll</strong>, creating a fully randomized but tonally coherent pattern each time the sketch loads.
