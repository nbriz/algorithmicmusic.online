This sketch works similarly to the previous examples, it uses <code>Tone.Transport</code> to drive a <strong>timed loop</strong>. But instead of triggering a sample using <code>Tone.Player</code>, it uses a <strong>Tone.PolySynth</strong> to synthesize a tone directly. Unlike our earlier synth examples where we passed raw <strong>frequency values</strong> and durations in seconds, here we're using Tone.jsâ€™s built-in <strong>note and timing strings</strong>. For example, <code>'A4'</code> represents the musical note A above middle C (440 Hz), and <code>'4n'</code> stands for a <strong>quarter note</strong>, one beat in 4/4 time.
