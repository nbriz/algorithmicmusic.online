The <code>randomizePattern()</code> function takes this a step further by creating a brand new, fully randomized rhythm each time it’s called. It stops and resets the <strong>Transport</strong>, sets a new <strong>BPM</strong> randomly between <code>90</code> and <code>300</code>, and generates a fresh 4-step pattern for each drum using random <strong>probability values</strong>. This means every sequence is unique and changes on each run. The UI is also updated by syncing the BPM input and rebuilding the <strong>step sequencer</strong> to reflect the new pattern. It’s a simple example of how generative structures can emerge from just a few lines of code.
