What's new here is the integration of a <strong>piano roll interface</strong> with <code>viz.createPianoRoll()</code>, which visually represents the melody on a grid of pitches and beats. The piano roll is synced to the <strong>Transport</strong>, so as the melody plays, the playhead moves in time. We also pre-populate the roll by manually adding each note with <code>roll.add()</code>, allowing users to see the full sequence laid out before and during playback. This creates a clear, visual link between the underlying data structure and the actual musical output.
