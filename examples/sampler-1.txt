In order to map an audio file to a specific "pitch", we pass a "urls" property to the Sampler's constructor. This parameter is itself an object which can contain multiple properties of it's own. The property names are typically note names (a concept will cover in the next lecture on music) and their values are paths (or URLs) to the sound we should hear when that "note" is played. in the example above i assigned the note "C4" this <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Open_front_unrounded_vowel.ogg" target="_blank">sample</a>. So later when we <code>triggerAttack('C4')</code> we hear that sample played back.
