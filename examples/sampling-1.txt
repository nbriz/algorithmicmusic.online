Tone.js provides a higher level abstraction for loading files from paths (whether those are locally saved in your project or hosted elsewhere online, as in the wiki media bird sounds clip above) and creating an audio buffer for it in a playable node. Like the Oscillators we've looked at in previous lessons, the <a href="https://tonejs.github.io/docs/15.0.4/classes/Player.html" target="_blank">Player</a> class is an audio "source node".
